  # Prosper is ad-hoc signed (free distribution, not Apple-notarized), so the
  # first launch would otherwise hit the Gatekeeper "unidentified developer"
  # dialog. Strip the quarantine flag on install so `brew install` is
  # prompt-free. (The app also self-strips on first launch via QuarantineStripper.)
